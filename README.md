This is a school project I made that I'm really proud of. It's a Bullet Hell engine made in Python using the John Zelle "graphics.py" package. 
Bullet Hells are a type of shooting game that focus on having a lot of bullets on screen that make nice looking patterns.
This package was NOT made for this type of project so apologies for the jankiness with movement, it (mostly) comes from graphics.py.
